# China's Gen AI Ecosystem Explained: Baidu, Alibaba, ByteDance, iFlytek, DeepSeek  
*What’s Mature, What’s Hype – A Practical Breakdown for Global AI Professionals*

Over the past year, China has emerged as a major player in the generative AI (Gen AI) race. While ChatGPT and OpenAI dominate global headlines, Chinese tech giants and research startups have been quietly building their own large language models (LLMs) aimed at serving over a billion Mandarin speakers.

If you’re a **data or AI professional looking to enter the Chinese market**, or a global enterprise trying to understand regional Gen AI capabilities, this guide will help you navigate the complex but exciting landscape.
