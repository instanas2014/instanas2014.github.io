# What Does a Data and AI Strategy Do?

**Data and AI strategy** has become a regular item on the agendas of senior leadership teams — and for good reason.  
But despite the attention, it often remains vague: *What exactly is it? Why is it important? And what makes it strategic?*

Recently, I had the opportunity to visit three excellent books:
- **Data Strategy** – Bernard Marr  
- **AI Strategy** – Bernard Marr  
- **The Business Case for AI** – Kavita Ganesan

These readings deeply resonated with my own real-world experiences and helped clarify what a Data and AI Strategy should **truly** entail. Most importantly, they reinforced a powerful insight:

> **Strategy is not just about alignment or high-level goals — it's about making deliberate choices that position a firm uniquely in the market.**

## What Is a Data and AI Strategy?

At its core, a Data and AI Strategy answers two key questions:
- **Why** data and AI are crucial to achieving your business ambitions  
- **What** specific actions, use cases, and enablers will set you apart

More than a checklist or alignment exercise, a strategy is a **choice** — about where to compete, how to win, and how to build advantage through data and AI.

### Example: Turning Strategic Goals into Competitive Differentiation

Imagine a company whose business strategy aims to stand out from its peers by focusing on:

1. Achieving **net-zero emissions**, and  
2. Delivering a **best-in-class customer experience**

A high-impact Data and AI Strategy shouldn’t just *support* these goals — it should **fundamentally shape how the company achieves them in ways that competitors can’t easily replicate**.


#### **The Why: Why Data & AI Enable True Differentiation**

The commpany may analyze and come to the conclusion that Data and AI create new possibilities:
- Enable **real-time tracking and predictive optimization** of carbon emissions — going beyond after-the-fact reporting.
- Power **hyper-personalized customer experiences**, anticipating needs and proactively delivering value.

But to truly unlock differentiation, a company must go further and ask themselves:

1. Does this create **a unique advantage over competitors**?
2. Does it **reshape the relationship with customers** — from reactive to anticipatory?
3. Does it **elevate the company’s role in the partner ecosystem** or open new collaborative opportunities?
4. Does it **reduce the threat of substitution** by increasing customer dependency or stickiness or simply better offering than any others in the market?
5. Does it **raise barriers to entry** by building capabilities or data assets that are difficult to copy?

These are the strategic angles where Data & AI create not just value — but **defensible, long-term advantage**.

#### **The What: From Strategy to Execution**

The company would then define a guiding policy — for example:  
**"Make sustainability and customer intimacy data-driven by default."**

And support it with a **coherent set of actions**, such as:

1. **Build proprietary AI models** to forecast and optimize emissions, giving the company a unique *carbon intelligence edge*.
2. **Deploy a real-time personalization engine** to tailor content, offers, and interactions across every customer channel.
3. **Embed AI practitioners within business teams**, enabling rapid experimentation, iteration, and innovation at the edge.
4. **Establish strong data governance**, focused not just on compliance but on creating trusted, reusable, and shareable data products.
5. **Modernize the data platform** to enable fast, scalable deployment of new use cases — while competitors remain bogged down in legacy systems.

👉 **This is what real differentiation looks like**:  
Not just doing the same things more efficiently — but doing entirely different, smarter things, faster, deeper, and at scale.

## How Is Data and AI Strategy Evolving?

Traditionally, organizations approached strategy by asking:  
“How can data and AI help us achieve our business goals?”

But in today’s **AI-first world**, the question must evolve into:  
“What new goals, business models, or opportunities can data and AI make possible for us?”

The best firms now build **business strategy and Data/AI strategy together**. That’s because:
- Data and AI aren’t just enablers — they’re becoming **core to value creation**
- Competitive advantage is increasingly **defined by how effectively organizations apply intelligence at scale**

## What’s the Difference Between Strategy and an Implementation Plan?

It’s common to confuse the two — but they’re not the same.

- **Strategy** = The **Why** and **What**  
- **Implementation Plan** = The **How**, **When**, **Where**, and **Who**

| Strategy                                   | Implementation Plan                          |
| ------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| Explains purpose and positioning           | Details execution and delivery               |
| Prioritizes where to play and how to win   | Breaks down timeline, teams, budget          |
| Defines enablers (data, tech, skills, org) | Defines scope, sprints, and responsibilities |

Think of it this way:

> **Strategy sets the direction. Implementation maps the path.**

## 🔑 20 Practical Insights for a Strong Data & AI Strategy

### 1. **No Data? Start Rule-Based.**  
Use rule-based logic to begin automating and collecting useful data before jumping into ML.

### 2. **Use B-CIDS to Assess Readiness.**  
Evaluate **Business, Culture, Infrastructure, Data, and Skills** as your AI foundation.

### 3. **Top-Down or Bottom-Up — Both Work.**  
Start with a clear business goal or discover pain points in existing processes.

### 4. **Hiring Alone Won’t Get You There.**  
Transformation requires structure, operating models, and leadership — not just a few data scientists.

### 5. **Iterate Your Strategy.**  
Avoid big-bang efforts. Deliver in small, valuable steps to build momentum.

### 6. **Use the Right Tools.**  
Don’t overuse ML. Sometimes simpler techniques (stats, heuristics) do the job just fine.

### 7. **Understand ML Types.**  
- **Analytical ML** = insights and discovery  
- **Operational ML** = real-time, continuous decisions (e.g., personalization, fraud)

### 8. **Play the Long Game.**  
AI transformation pays off gradually. Value compounds over time.

### 9. **Invest in Data Quality Early.**  
You can’t outsmart bad data. AI is only as good as its input.

### 10. **Don’t Bet Everything on One Use Case.**  
A single high-profile POC won’t transform your business. Build broader readiness.

### 11. **Measure What Matters.**  
Track:
- Business value
- User adoption
- Technical performance

### 12. **Clarify Strategy vs. Plan vs. TOM.**  
- **Strategy** = Why & What  
- **Plan** = Where, When, How  
- **TOM (Target Operating Model)** = Who

### 13. **Start Small, Think Big.**  
Build MVPs that scale. Compound value through iteration.

### 14. **Use Bernard Marr’s Framework:**  
For each top use case, define:
- Data needs  
- Governance  
- Tech foundation  
- Skills & teams  
- Change management

### 15. **Move Toward an AI-Native Model.**  
Don't just digitize old processes — reimagine them through an AI lens.

### 16. **Stay Strategic.**  
Avoid “AI for AI’s sake.” Focus on areas where it **moves the needle**.

### 17. **Leadership Must Lead.**  
AI literacy at the executive level is a must. Change starts at the top.

### 18. **Pilot with Purpose.**  
Build MVPs that are scalable and budget for operational rollout — not just POCs.

### 19. **Be Financially Iterative.**  
Don’t wait for perfect ROI models. Deliver early wins, then reinvest.

### 20. **Actively Manage AI Risk.**  
Cover all angles — from security and compliance to fairness and explainability.

## Final Thought

A good Data and AI Strategy doesn’t just support the business —  
> **It redefines what’s possible, and charts a bold, differentiated path to get there.**

In the age of AI, strategy isn't about following — it's about **leading through intelligence**.
