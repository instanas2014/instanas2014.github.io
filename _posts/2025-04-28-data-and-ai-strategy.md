# What does a Data and AI Strategy Do?

**Data and AI strategy** has been a recurring topic at senior leadership discussions for quite some time.  
Yet despite the attention, it often remains somewhat vague: *What exactly does it include? Why is it important?*

Recently, I had the chance to dive into three insightful books:
- **Data Strategy** ‚Äì Bernard Marr
- **AI Strategy** ‚Äì Bernard Marr
- **The Business Case for AI** ‚Äì Kavita Ganesan

These readings strongly resonated with my own real-world experiences. They not only validated many of the challenges and patterns I‚Äôve seen in practice, but also gave me a much sharper and more structured view of what a Data and AI Strategy should truly entail ‚Äî and why getting it right is more critical than ever.

## What Is a Data and AI Strategy?

At its core, a Data and AI Strategy answers the **"Why"** and the **"What"** behind how an organization uses data and AI to achieve its business goals.

**For example**, imagine a company's business strategy focuses on:
1. Achieving **net zero emissions**, and
2. Delivering a **best-in-class customer experience**.

A strong Data and AI Strategy would explain:

- **Why** data and AI matter for these goals:
  - Data and AI allow better tracking of environmental metrics, generate actionable insights, and enable faster execution through AI-driven automation.
  - Data and AI drive hyper-personalized customer experiences that deepen loyalty and satisfaction.

- **What** needs to happen to enable it:
  1. Apply data and AI to ESG initiatives, like carbon emission optimization and ESG reporting.
  2. Implement hyper-personalization across customer journeys.
  3. Redesign the Data and AI operating model to be more agile and scalable.
  4. Strengthen data governance frameworks to manage risks and quality.
  5. Upgrade technology and infrastructure to support future demands.

In short, the strategy creates a clear bridge from **business ambition** to **data and AI action**.

## How Is Data and AI Strategy Evolving?

Traditionally, the advice was simple: **align data and AI initiatives with business strategy**.  
In other words, business goals came first, and data and AI played a supporting role.

But in the emerging **AI-first era** ‚Äî arguably already here ‚Äî this thinking needs to evolve.  
It‚Äôs no longer enough to just align after the fact.

Today, **business strategy and Data/AI strategy must be designed together**.  
Data and AI are no longer enablers sitting quietly in the background ‚Äî they are fundamental drivers that can create new business models, new revenue streams, and competitive advantages.

This shift changes the conversation at the top. It‚Äôs not just, "How can data and AI help us do this?" ‚Äî it‚Äôs, "What opportunities and strategies can data and AI unlock for us that we couldn‚Äôt even imagine before?"

## How Is It Different from an Implementation Plan?

Another common mistake is confusing **strategy** with an **implementation plan**.

- **Strategy** focuses on the **"Why"** and the **"What"** ‚Äî the goals, the priorities, the areas of investment.
- **Implementation plans** focus on the **"How," "When," "Where,"** and **"Who"** ‚Äî how to deliver the strategy.

An implementation plan typically includes:
- Detailed use case requirements and a prioritized backlog
- Timeline and major milestones
- Scope and phased delivery
- Budget and resource allocation

Simply put:  
**Strategy sets the destination. Implementation maps the journey.**

Both are critical ‚Äî but without a clear, well-articulated strategy, even the best execution risks going in the wrong direction.

## üîë Key Insights for a Practical Data & AI Strategy

### 1. No Data? Start Rule-Based.
If you lack quality data for ML/DL, begin with rule-based automation. It helps collect useful data and test key features and targets.

### 2. Use B-CIDS to Guide Readiness.
**B-CIDS** = Business, Culture, Infrastructure, Data, Skills ‚Äî your foundation before launching the AI journey.

### 3. Two Doors to AI Opportunity.
Start with a clear business problem (**top-down**) or uncover pain points in processes, customer journeys, or legacy systems (**bottom-up**).

### 4. Hiring Isn‚Äôt Enough.
A few data scientists or engineers alone won‚Äôt transform your business. Structure, strategy, and cross-functional alignment are key.

### 5. Iterate Your Strategy.
Avoid the ‚Äúbig bang‚Äù approach. Build iteratively and show value step-by-step.

### 6. Don‚Äôt Use a Hammer for Every Nail.
ML is powerful, but not always necessary. Sometimes simple stats or search logic is enough.

### 7. Know the Two Flavors of ML.
- **Analytical ML** for insights  
- **Operational ML** for continuous decision-making (e.g., recommendations, anomaly detection)

### 8. AI Transformation Takes Time.
The biggest gains are visible in hindsight. Be patient‚Äîlong-term value builds gradually.

### 9. Your AI is Only as Good as Your Data.
Poor data quality limits AI outcomes. Invest early in data quality and management.

### 10. Avoid the ‚ÄúOne-Use-Case Trap.‚Äù
Don't hinge your transformation on one flashy AI case. Without culture and readiness, it stalls.

### 11. Measure What Matters.
Track success across:
- **Business impact**
- **User adoption**
- **Technical performance**

### 12. Clarify Strategy, Plan, and TOM.
- **Strategy** = Why & What  
- **Plan** = Where, How, When  
- **TOM (Target Operating Model)** = Who

### 13. Start Small. Think Big.
Big change = sum of small, scalable wins. Build momentum with MVPs.

### 14. BM‚Äôs Data Strategy Framework:
1. Link business strategy to **top 5 data use cases**
2. Define:
   - Data requirements  
   - Data governance  
   - Technology  
   - Skills & capacity  
   - Implementation & change management

### 15. From Digital to AI-Native.
Every business is becoming a **Data & AI business**.  
Make AI part of your **core strategy**, not just an alignment.

Focus on:
- Decision-making & automation  
- Customers & markets  
- Products & services

### 16. Stay Strategic.
Resist applying AI where it doesn‚Äôt align with business goals.

### 17. Leadership Must Lead.
Executive **AI literacy and sponsorship** are essential. Change starts at the top.

### 18. Pilot with Purpose.
Treat MVPs as real, scalable solutions. Budget for deployment, not just POC.

### 19. Iterate Financially, Too.
Stay ballpark with ROI estimates. Refine as you go and aim for self-funding through value delivered.

### 20. Manage AI-Specific Risks.
Proactively address:
- Technical  
- Operational  
- Societal  
- Reputational  
- Security  
- Data  
- Compliance risks
