# What does a Data and AI Strategy Do?

**Data and AI strategy** has been a recurring topic at senior leadership discussions for quite some time.  
Yet despite the attention, it often remains somewhat vague: *What exactly does it include? Why is it important?*

Recently, I had the chance to dive into three insightful books:
- **Data Strategy** – Bernard Marr
- **AI Strategy** – Bernard Marr
- **The Business Case for AI** – Kavita Ganesan

These readings strongly resonated with my own real-world experiences. They not only validated many of the challenges and patterns I’ve seen in practice, but also gave me a much sharper and more structured view of what a Data and AI Strategy should truly entail — and why getting it right is more critical than ever.

## What Is a Data and AI Strategy?

At its core, a Data and AI Strategy answers the **"Why"** and the **"What"** behind how an organization uses data and AI to achieve its business goals.

**For example**, imagine a company's business strategy focuses on:
1. Achieving **net zero emissions**, and
2. Delivering a **best-in-class customer experience**.

A strong Data and AI Strategy would explain:

- **Why** data and AI matter for these goals:
  - Data and AI allow better tracking of environmental metrics, generate actionable insights, and enable faster execution through AI-driven automation.
  - Data and AI drive hyper-personalized customer experiences that deepen loyalty and satisfaction.

- **What** needs to happen to enable it:
  1. Apply data and AI to ESG initiatives, like carbon emission optimization and ESG reporting.
  2. Implement hyper-personalization across customer journeys.
  3. Redesign the Data and AI operating model to be more agile and scalable.
  4. Strengthen data governance frameworks to manage risks and quality.
  5. Upgrade technology and infrastructure to support future demands.

In short, the strategy creates a clear bridge from **business ambition** to **data and AI action**.

## How Is Data and AI Strategy Evolving?

Traditionally, the advice was simple: **align data and AI initiatives with business strategy**.  
In other words, business goals came first, and data and AI played a supporting role.

But in the emerging **AI-first era** — arguably already here — this thinking needs to evolve.  
It’s no longer enough to just align after the fact.

Today, **business strategy and Data/AI strategy must be designed together**.  
Data and AI are no longer enablers sitting quietly in the background — they are fundamental drivers that can create new business models, new revenue streams, and competitive advantages.

This shift changes the conversation at the top. It’s not just, "How can data and AI help us do this?" — it’s, "What opportunities and strategies can data and AI unlock for us that we couldn’t even imagine before?"

## How Is It Different from an Implementation Plan?

Another common mistake is confusing **strategy** with an **implementation plan**.

- **Strategy** focuses on the **"Why"** and the **"What"** — the goals, the priorities, the areas of investment.
- **Implementation plans** focus on the **"How," "When," "Where,"** and **"Who"** — how to deliver the strategy.

An implementation plan typically includes:
- Detailed use case requirements and a prioritized backlog
- Timeline and major milestones
- Scope and phased delivery
- Budget and resource allocation

Simply put:  
**Strategy sets the destination. Implementation maps the journey.**

Both are critical — but without a clear, well-articulated strategy, even the best execution risks going in the wrong direction.
